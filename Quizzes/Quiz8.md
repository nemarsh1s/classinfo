Syntax differences  
It is easy to mix up syntax between JavaScript and Python when you regularly work in both languages.  
For each of these differences, is the refernced languages JavaScript or Python?  
2 pts each. Max of 15 pts.  
  
1. Uses curly braces {} to designate code blocks instead of whitespace.  
  
2. Indentation matters.  
  
3. Functions are always defined by the ```def``` keyword.  
  
4. Allows for "anonymous" functions with no name at all, which can be defined in the middle of other code blocks.  
  
5. Automatically coerces a larger number of datatypes, without the need to explicitly define a coercion, e.g. ```str(1)```.
  
6. Ends lines of code with a newline instead of with a semicolon.  
  
7. Variables can be defined with the ```var``` keyword, and use the global scope if ```var``` is not used.  
  
8. Native datatypes include Lists ```[1,2,3]``` or Tuples ```(1,2,3)```, but not Arrays ```[1,2,3]```.  
  
9. 3 pt Bonus: This language does not have immutable datatypes.
